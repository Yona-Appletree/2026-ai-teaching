# Yona Implement

Use this skill to execute an existing `plan.md` with disciplined validation.

## Plan Location

Plans usually live under:

```text
docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/plan.md
```

If the user provides an explicit plan path, use it. Otherwise:

1. Determine the repo root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. If the project is not a git repo, use the current working directory.
2. Look under `docs/plans/` for active plans.
3. If several plans match, ask the user which one to execute.

Completed plans should be archived under:

```text
docs/archive/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/
```

## Setup

Read `plan.md` first. Inspect:

- `depth`
- phase/work-item files such as `01-*.md`
- phase directories with their own `plan.md`
- ADR expectations/candidates
- validation commands
- existing `_DONE.md`, if present

If the plan is missing phase files but marks a work item as `sub-phases required`, write those sub-phase files before implementation.

If `_DONE.md` already exists for the requested plan, inspect it and the current plan status before continuing. Ask before re-running completed work unless the user explicitly requested a follow-up or repair.

## Execution

For each work item:

1. Execute directly or delegate to another agent when appropriate and available.
2. Keep the work inside the stated scope.
3. Review every delegated result before moving on.
4. Re-run the work-item validation commands.
5. Record phase-level implementation results when phase files exist.
6. Check for shortcuts: TODOs, stubbed logic, suppressed warnings, disabled tests, scope creep, or unrelated refactors.

If a phase says `sub-phases recommended`, decide whether to split before execution. If it says `sub-phases required`, split before execution.

Delegated agents should not commit unless the user explicitly asked them to.

When recording phase-level implementation results, append a short section to the phase file instead of renaming it:

```md
## Implementation Result

Status: done
Completed: YYYY-MM-DD
Commit: pending

- Changed: ...
- Validated: ...
- Deviations: none
```

After the final commit exists, update `Commit: pending` entries with the commit SHA when practical.

## Stop And Ask

Pause before continuing when:

- The plan is ambiguous or contradictory.
- Validation fails twice for the same work item.
- Fixing an issue would expand scope or change public APIs beyond the plan.
- A hard bug appears that needs real debugging.
- The requested plan path cannot be resolved.

## ADRs

Do not write `summary.md`.

After implementation and validation, evaluate ADR candidates against the completed diff.

Create accepted ADR files in the repo when a decision meets this criterion:

> The change chooses a direction among plausible alternatives and that choice has lasting architectural, operational, security, data-model, API, workflow, or cross-repo/process consequences.

Use:

```text
docs/adr/YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md
```

If no ADR is warranted, state that in the final response.

Historical ADR backfill is different: produce an ADR candidate list for human review before creating historical ADR files unless the user explicitly approved the candidates.

## Implementation Log

After implementation, validation, ADR handling, and any requested commit, write `_DONE.md` in the planning directory. This is the completion log for what actually happened, separate from ADRs and separate from `notes.md`.

Use frontmatter:

```md
---
kind: implementation-log
status: done
repo: <repo-slug>
plan: plan.md
completed: YYYY-MM-DD
commit: <sha-or-none>
adrs:
  - docs/adr/...
---
```

Then include:

- Outcome.
- Completed work.
- Validation commands and results.
- Deviations from the plan, or `None`.
- ADRs created, or why no ADR was warranted.
- Follow-up work that remains outside the completed scope.

Update `plan.md` frontmatter to `status: done` and add `completed: YYYY-MM-DD` and `commit: <sha-or-none>`.

Do not rename `plan.md` or phase files after completion.

## Commit

If the user asked for a commit, create a single conventional commit once validation passes unless the plan explicitly calls for checkpoints.

Commit code, plan artifacts, and ADRs together. Include ADR paths in the commit body when ADRs were created.

If the user did not ask for a commit, leave the worktree ready for review and clearly report the changed files and validation results.

## Archive

After `_DONE.md` is written and the user-requested commit behavior is handled, move the completed planning directory from:

```text
docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/
```

to:

```text
docs/archive/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/
```

If a destination already exists, add a short suffix such as `-v2` rather than overwriting it.

If the repo uses git and the move should be committed, include the archive move in the implementation commit when possible. If the move happens after the commit, report it clearly so the user can decide whether to commit the archive update.

## Completion

Finish with:

- Outcome.
- Files changed.
- Validation commands and results.
- ADRs created, or why none were warranted.
- Archive path.
- Commit SHA, if a commit was created.
- Any remaining follow-up work.
